# Exploring_Nicolas_Cage
Investigate a dataset of movies from TMDB.

In this project I used Pyton with Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook to investigate a movie dataset from The Movie Database (TMDB).

Please use Git Pages link to view the project walkthrough:

Otherwise, you can download the IPYNB file and follow along in your own Jupyter Notebook.

Source data can be viewed in "tmdb_movies" file.

All the best,

Nicholas Hodges
